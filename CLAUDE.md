# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a comprehensive microservices backend for a blockchain-based reciprocal club membership platform. The system consists of 8 microservices with multi-tenant architecture, event-driven communication via NATS, and Hyperledger Fabric blockchain integration.

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build all services
make build

# Build specific service
cd services/auth-service && go build -o bin/auth-service ./cmd/main.go

# Run all tests across services
make test

# Run tests for specific service
cd services/auth-service && go test ./...

# Run only unit tests (faster)
make test-unit

# Test compilation without running tests
go test -c ./internal/...

# Format all code
make format

# Run linters
make lint
```

### Container Orchestration

```bash
# Start full system with Podman (preferred)
make podman-up

# Start with Docker Compose
make docker-up

# Check service status
make podman-status

# View logs for specific service
make podman-logs SERVICE=postgres

make db-migrate

# Tidy all Go modules
make tidy
```

## Architecture Overview

### Microservices Structure
- **8 services**: API Gateway, Auth, Member, Reciprocal, Blockchain, Notification, Analytics, Governance
- **Shared packages**: Located in `pkg/shared/` for common functionality
- **Multi-tenant**: Club-based data partitioning with tenant isolation
- **Event-driven**: NATS message bus for inter-service communication

### Service Structure Pattern
Each service follows a consistent internal structure:
```
services/{service-name}/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/main.go              # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handlers/            # HTTP/gRPC handlers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service/             # Business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository/          # Data access layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/              # Domain models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/              # Service configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ testutil/            # Test utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â””â”€â”€ go.mod
```

### Shared Libraries
Key shared packages in `pkg/shared/`:
- **config**: Environment configuration with Viper
- **database**: PostgreSQL connections and GORM integration
- **messaging**: NATS client with retry logic
- **logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health checks
- **auth**: JWT authentication and multi-tenant authorization
- **errors**: Structured error handling

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Data Access
- All database operations must include `club_id` for tenant isolation
- Repository methods typically require `clubID` as first parameter
- Example: `repo.GetUserByID(ctx, clubID, userID)`

### Service Communication
- **Synchronous**: gRPC for request/response patterns
- **Asynchronous**: NATS events for eventual consistency
- **External APIs**: HTTP REST with structured error responses

### Configuration Management
- Services use `config.Load(serviceName)` to load configuration
- Environment variables override YAML defaults
- Shared configuration patterns via `pkg/shared/config`

### Testing Patterns
- **Unit tests**: Mock external dependencies, focus on business logic
- **Integration tests**: Use `testutil.NewTestDB()` for database testing
- **Service tests**: Test full service layer with mocked repositories
- All test files must compile with `go test -c ./internal/...`

## Database Considerations

### Connection Management
- Use `database.NewConnection(&cfg.Database, logger)` for connections
- All services share PostgreSQL but with tenant isolation
- Auto-migration on service startup via `db.Migrate(models...)`

### Repository Pattern
- Repository constructors: `NewAuthRepository(db, logger)`
- Always pass context as first parameter: `repo.Method(ctx, ...)`
- Use tenant-aware queries with `db.WithTenant(clubID)`

## Error Handling Standards

### Structured Errors
- Use `pkg/shared/errors` for consistent error types
- Return structured errors: `errors.NotFound("Resource not found", context)`
- Log errors with correlation IDs from context

### HTTP Error Responses
- 400 for validation errors
- 401 for authentication failures
- 403 for authorization failures
- 404 for not found resources
- 500 for internal server errors
