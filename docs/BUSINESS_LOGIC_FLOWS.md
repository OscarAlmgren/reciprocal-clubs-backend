# Business Logic Sequence Flows for Reciprocal Clubs Platform

## Overview

This document details the business logic sequence flows for different user journeys in the Reciprocal Clubs platform. These flows are designed to support two primary Flutter applications:

1. **Administrator App**: For club reception and backoffice operations

## Core Business Entities

### Primary Entities
- **User**: System user with authentication credentials
- **Club**: Reciprocal club organization with facilities and rules

- **Agreement**: Bilateral agreement between clubs for reciprocal access
- **Visit**: Member visit to a reciprocal club
- **Reservation**: Booking for club facilities or services
- **Transaction**: Financial transaction (fees, payments, etc.)
- **Blockchain Record**: Immutable record on Hyperledger Fabric

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Network Connectivity Issues
- Offline mode for critical functions
- Queue synchronization when connection restored
- Local caching of essential data

### Payment Failures
- Transaction rollback procedures
- Alternative payment method prompts
- Manual reconciliation processes

### Agreement Conflicts
- Real-time validation during visits
- Grace period policies
- Escalation to club management

### Blockchain Integration Failures
- Fallback to traditional database
- Delayed blockchain synchronization
- Integrity verification processes

## Data Synchronization Patterns

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connections for live notifications
- Push notifications for critical updates
- Background sync for non-critical data

### Conflict Resolution
- Last-write-wins for profile updates
- Merge strategies for preferences
- Manual resolution for financial conflicts

### Backup and Recovery
- Automated daily backups
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Cross-region data replication

This comprehensive business logic documentation provides the foundation for developing both Administrator and End User Flutter applications with full understanding of the platform's operational workflows.
