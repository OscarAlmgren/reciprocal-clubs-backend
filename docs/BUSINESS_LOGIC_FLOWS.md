```

### Detailed Flow Steps

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Administrator App sends GraphQL query with JWT token
   - API Gateway validates token via Auth Service (gRPC)
   - Auth Service checks Redis cache for token validity
   - Permission validation for `visit_manage` capability

2. **Member Lookup**
   - GraphQL query: `memberByNumber($memberNumber)`
   - API Gateway calls Member Service via gRPC
   - Member Service queries PostgreSQL for member profile
   - Results cached in Redis for performance
   - Returns member profile + home club information

3. **Reciprocal Agreement Validation**
   - GraphQL query: `reciprocalAgreements` with club filters
   - API Gateway calls Reciprocal Service via gRPC
   - Service validates agreement between home club and visiting club
   - Checks agreement status, expiry, and usage limits
   - Returns permitted services and any restrictions

4. **Visit Record Creation**
   - GraphQL mutation: `recordVisit($input)`
   - API Gateway calls Visit Service via gRPC
   - Visit Service creates record in PostgreSQL
   - Publishes `VisitCreated` event to NATS message bus

5. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Blockchain Service receives event from NATS
   - Submits transaction to Hyperledger Fabric network
   - Records immutable visit proof on blockchain
   - Updates visit record with transaction ID

6. **Real-time Notifications**
   - Notification Service receives event from NATS
   - Creates notification record for member
   - Sends real-time update via GraphQL subscription
   - Updates club dashboard with new visitor

## 2. Member Profile Update Flow (Backoffice Operation)

### Flow Overview
**Trigger**: Administrator needs to update member information
**Initiator**: Club Administrator via Administrator App

        Member->>Cache: Cache member data
    end
    Member-->>Gateway: Current member profile
    Gateway-->>Admin: Member profile for editing

    Note over Admin: Administrator updates member information

    Admin->>Gateway: GraphQL Mutation: updateMember($id, $input)
    Gateway->>Member: gRPC: UpdateMember(memberId, profileData)

    Member->>DB: BEGIN TRANSACTION
    Member->>DB: UPDATE members SET profile = ? WHERE id = ?
    Member->>DB: INSERT INTO member_audit_log (member_id, changes, admin_id)

    Member->>NATS: Publish MemberUpdated event
    NATS->>Blockchain: Receive member update event
    Blockchain->>Fabric: Submit transaction: updateMemberRecord(memberId, changeHash, adminId)
    Fabric-->>Blockchain: Transaction confirmed

    Audit->>DB: INSERT INTO audit_trail (entity_type, entity_id, action, admin_id)

    Member-->>Gateway: Updated member profile + blockchain confirmation
    Gateway-->>Admin: Success response with updated data

    Note over Gateway: Real-time update via GraphQL subscription
    Gateway->>Admin: Subscription: memberUpdated event
```

### Detailed Flow Steps

1. **Permission Validation**
   - Administrator App requests member data for editing
   - API Gateway validates `member_write` permission via Auth Service
   - Auth Service checks role-based access control (RBAC)

2. **Current Data Retrieval**
   - GraphQL query: `member($id)` for existing profile
   - Member Service checks Redis cache first
   - On cache miss, queries PostgreSQL and caches result
   - Returns complete member profile to Administrator

3. **Profile Update Transaction**
   - GraphQL mutation: `updateMember($id, $input)`
   - Member Service starts database transaction
   - Updates member profile in PostgreSQL
   - Creates audit log entry with change details

4. **Blockchain Record**
   - Publishes `MemberUpdated` event to NATS
   - Blockchain Service creates hash of changes
   - Submits immutable record to Hyperledger Fabric
   - Updates member record with blockchain confirmation

5. **Cache Management**
   - Invalidates old member cache entry
   - Caches updated member profile
   - Ensures data consistency across requests

6. **Audit Trail**
   - Audit Service receives event and creates compliance record
   - Tracks administrator action with timestamp
   - Maintains full change history for regulatory compliance

   - Analytics Service updates club ratings
   - Gamification Service awards points for review
   - Updates member point totals

4. **Social Notifications**
   - Notifies member's social connections
   - Real-time notifications via GraphQL subscriptions
   - Updates activity feeds for followers
   - Maintains privacy settings

5. **Activity Sharing**
   - Optional sharing to social feed
   - GraphQL mutation: `shareActivity` with privacy controls
   - Real-time feed updates for connected members
   - Social engagement tracking

## 4. Travel Planning and Companion Matching Flow

### Flow Overview
**Trigger**: Member planning travel to new destination

## Real-Time Communication Patterns

### GraphQL Subscription Architecture

```mermaid

    participant Client as Flutter App
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant WS as WebSocket Manager
    participant Service as Business Service
    participant NATS as Message Bus
    participant DB as Database

    Client->>Gateway: WebSocket Connection + JWT
    Gateway->>WS: Establish authenticated connection

    Client->>Gateway: GraphQL Subscription: visitStatusChanged($clubId)
    Gateway->>WS: Register subscription with filters

    Note over Service,DB: Business event occurs
    Service->>DB: Update data
    Service->>NATS: Publish domain event
    NATS->>WS: Receive filtered event
    WS->>Gateway: Format GraphQL subscription response
    Gateway->>Client: Real-time update delivered
```

## Security and Authorization Flow

### JWT Token Lifecycle

```mermaid

    [*] --> Unauthenticated
    Unauthenticated --> Authenticating: Login Request
    Authenticating --> Authenticated: JWT Issued
    Authenticated --> Refreshing: Token Near Expiry

    Refreshing --> Unauthenticated: Refresh Failed
    Authenticated --> Unauthenticated: Logout
    Authenticated --> Unauthenticated: Token Expired
```

## Performance and Caching Strategy
