## Detailed Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Priority (Next 2-4 weeks)

#### 1.1 Resolve Dependency Issues

**Problem**: Cannot run comprehensive tests due to missing dependencies.

**Recommendations**:
```bash
# Create shared package implementations
mkdir -p pkg/shared/{auth,config,logging,messaging,monitoring,database,errors,utils}

# Implement basic shared packages
# Priority order: config, logging, errors, database, messaging
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create minimal viable implementations of shared packages
2. Update go.mod files with proper dependency versions
3. Generate protobuf files for gRPC communication
4. Create mock implementations for testing

**Impact**: High - Enables testing and development

#### 1.2 Complete Auth Service Implementation

**Current State**: 70% complete
**Missing Components**:
- JWT token refresh mechanism
- Multi-factor authentication
- Password reset functionality
- Account lockout logic

**Recommendations**:
```go
// Add refresh token handling
func (s *AuthService) RefreshToken(ctx context.Context, refreshToken string) (*TokenResponse, error) {
    // Implement token refresh logic
    // Validate refresh token
    // Generate new access token
    // Rotate refresh token
}

// Add MFA support
func (s *AuthService) EnableMFA(ctx context.Context, userID string, method MFAMethod) error {
    // Implement MFA enablement
}
```

**Estimated Effort**: 1 week
**Impact**: High - Core authentication functionality

#### 1.3 Implement Shared Configuration Management

**Problem**: No centralized configuration management.

**Recommendations**:
```go
// pkg/shared/config/config.go
type Config struct {
    Service  ServiceConfig  `yaml:"service"`
    Database DatabaseConfig `yaml:"database"`
    NATS     NATSConfig     `yaml:"nats"`
    Auth     AuthConfig     `yaml:"auth"`
    Logging  LoggingConfig  `yaml:"logging"`
}

func LoadConfig(configPath string) (*Config, error) {
